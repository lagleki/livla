{"w":"aigne","t":"fu'ivla","d":"$x_1$ is an eigenvalue (or zero) of linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$, associated with/'owning' all vectors in generalized eigenspace $x_3$ (implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy; default includes the zero vector) with 'eigenspace-generalization' power/exponent $x_4$ (typically and probably by cultural default will be 1), with algebraic multiplicity (of eigenvalue) $x_5$","n":"For any eigenvector v in generalized eigenspace $x_3$ of linear transformation $x_2$ for eigenvalue $x_1$, where I is the identity matrix/transformation that works/makes sense in the context, the following equation is satisfied: $((x_2 - x_1 I)^{x_4})v = 0$. When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is 'eigen-ness', the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word. Use this word as a seltau in constructions such as 'eigenket', 'eigenstate', etc. (In such cases, {te} {aigne} is recommended for the typical English usages of such terms. Use {zei} in lujvo formed by these constructs. The term 'eigenvector' may be rendered as {cmima} {be} {le} {te} {aigne}).

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of '0' with '01' and each occurrence of '1' with '10'; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).","g":"bit conjugation;bitwise binary negation;combinatorial line;digit expansion;find-and-replace"},

Presumably objects that have the same symbol as A but different B and C values are mutual(ly) related/analogs, but are at least formally distinguishable. B and C each default to 1. In practice, tick marks are usually called prime marks (and probably will effectively/culturally have a value of C=1); other distinguishing features are employed usually once these are used, such as overbars, over-tildes/over-twiddles, dagger, asterisks, etc. For a fixed C, this operator forms a series in B for each A. The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned). It is possible therefore to reference both primed and unprimed objects of form A simultaneously via reference to, for example, (1±1)/2 for the value for B and/or C (employing the setting of defaulting to the value of 1 as appropriate).","g":"append prime mark"},

{"w":"daigno","t":"fu'ivla","d":"$x_1$ (ordered list) is a sampling of entries of matrix/tensor $x_2$ in which exactly one entry is sampled from each row and/or column (etc.) between entries $x_3$ (list; default: the largest 'square'/'hypercubic' sampling possible in the entire tensor starting with the first entry, see notes) inclusively following selection procedure/rule/function/order $x_4$ (default: diagonally, see notes), where the tensor/matrix is expressed in basis/under conditions $x_5$","n":"Entries of the list in x3 need not actually be sampled; the entries listed are merely to name the minimal and maximal indices between which the sampling may be drawn.  Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include ('draw') the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1. Any mention of geometric terminology (such as mention of diagonals, orthotopes, etc.) in the definition or notes of this word should be interpreted cautiously and is not necessarily good Lojbanic practice; such terminology should not necessarily be emulated in practicing Lojbanic thought or speech.

The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in 'de'ai xy').  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by 'de'ai zo'e'. The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow 'xy' (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) '{zo'e}' (possibly necessitating terminators), '{di'au}', or 'xy' itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them. See also: {dai'o}, {de'au}, {de'ei}, {de'oi}, {di'au}, {di'ei}, {di'oi}.","g":"default assignment;default specification over-write;new default assignment;new default definition"},

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default override (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so overridden all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

If m is defined, then its contextless default value is m = 0. It first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for x; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after x; let this base be represented by b throughout this description. If the base is not a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, then t is defined; if the base is sufficiently bad or unclear, then t is undefined; if t is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the n or m slot, whichever one is later yet defined) and b = 1 for the purposes of this definition (but not for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion!). If t is defined, then its contextless default value is t = 0.  The rounding function, determined by n, is performed $(b^{t})*x$. If n = 1, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{t})*x$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it.  If n = -1, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{t})*x$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If n = 0, then the rounding function maps $(b^{t})*x$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{t})*x$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{t})*x$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where 'nearest'-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{t})*x$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer Z such that 2Z+m is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus n = 0 produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function.  In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by $b^(-t)$.  Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit, so to speak. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification.","g":"nearest integer function;floor function;ceiling function;rounding function"},

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as 'li {dau}'), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a 'later' term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus '23' in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of 'la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo' will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, '23' in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the '{pi'e}' implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next '{pi'e}') and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent '{pi'e}' (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","g":"macrodigit named base specifier;long-digit interpretation specifier"},

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

Inside the module formed by the 'sei'au' brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.  See also: {de'ai}.","g":"terbri-level function application"},

(notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made.

This word can be used to specify the concept of 'nth cousin m-times removed'-ness; x1 and x2 would be the cousins, x3-1 = n, and x4 is related to m but is signed. The relationship need not actually be cousinhood  (as perceived by English); direct ancestor-defendant pairs, (aunt/uncle)-(niece/nephew) pairs, and in fact any pair of family members with a well-specified most recent common ancestor (that is known) have this relationship to one another. This word can be used for specifying the number of 'great''s in the title of a relationship between x1 and x2 (with some calculational forethought). The tree diagram can be more generic than a family tree though; thus cousinhood is just a way to put it into context/application and is noy really essential to the meaning except through analogy. Notice the ordering of all terms; if the graph is directed, the arguments of the distance matters. The graph should probably be a tree locally if it is to be a well-defined relationship.","g":"cousin order;consanguinity values;cousin degree;cousin removal;degree of removal;kinship number"},

Speaker determines how close 'approximately twenty-one centimeters' is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, 'hyperfine spin-flip transition' might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.

The default value of n is itself 'xo'e', thus transforming this word into a 0-ary operator. The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA's if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo'e} is considered to represent exactly one digit in the given base until it is converted into a number. Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur in therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.  This word 'knows where it lives', meaning that it will only produce digit strings that are composed of PA's that are allowed by the base, that form allowed macrodigits, and which will represent part of a context-allowed number. Proposed rafsi: '-xon-', where this default case (n = xo'e) is assumed (thus, as a rafsi, '-xon-' represents any number that is expressible in the base by a string of concatenated digits and radix point(s) and which makes sense/satisfies implicit conditions placed upon it (such as signum, or being integer, etc.); this meaning is usually described by using variables 'n' or 'x' in English, such as in: 'n-ary', 'n-many', 'x-meter-long', etc.).","g":"string of vague/elliptical digits"},

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by 'li'), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean 'truth' and 'false', rather than '1' and '0' respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a 'li'-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: 'mi na na nelci' is nearly equivalent to 'mi nelci'; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, '[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci' is equivalent to 'mi ba'e na nelci' or something of the like; '[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci' would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).  This word is intended mostly for stylistic purposes and translations, as well as enabling further cultural neutrality. lai .krtisfranks. requests that this word (and all of its relevant information, including the selma'o label) be mapped to '{zau'eu}' if the string 'eu' ever becomes officially accepted in Lojban.","g":"double-negative toggle;negation mode toggle;affirmation toggle;multiplicative negation indicator;additive negation indicator"},

In other words, {zei} is distributed left-groupingly between each word; each word is treated on its own, individually; the quote is not treated as a whole. The final word is interpreted to have {zei} after it as well (this is a quirk of {zei'oi}), thus the quote is a string of rafsi, left-groupingly considered to be a rafsi. In order to end the lujvo formed with such a quote, follow it by {co'e}. This word compactifies large {zei}-clauses/-statements. For the perhaps generally more useful, if slightly more ambiguous, quote marker that treats the quote as a whole entity and converts it singly and wholly into a rafsi (rather than a rafsi string, as is done by this word), see: {zei'ei}. This word works as {zei'ei} does in all other regards (including as a marker for a new word (specifically a lujvo) unless preceded by {zei} or possibly by a standalone and otherwise ungrammatical rafsi).

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: 'non-integrable', 'non-measurable' (confer: '.{umre}'), 'non-summable' (say, of strings), 'the limit does not exist'. This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike '{zi'o}'); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of '{zo'e}' is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, 'lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i' is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by '{tseingu}' is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless.

Further glosses: counterclockwise, locally leftward, left-turning (with no bulk translation) in a way that would be characterized as 'positive' by the right-hand rule (aligned with and in the direction of a basis vector, at least for a given component). x1 is right-handedly/counterclockwise(ly) oriented relative to x2 on/along x3 in frame of reference x4  x1 is right-handed (one sense) from x2 [more accurately: moving from x2 to x1 requires a(n imaginary) motion that is right-handed along x3 as seen in frame/orientation/perspective x4]. x1 is to the path-following left of x2 (where the path is connected; as such, x1 is also be to the path-following right of x2, although there is an implication that the former is the smaller (or equal-length) path).

In particular, he recognizes that “-zu’a-” might be confusing as a rafsi for this word while being a modal cmavo for {zunle}; but he does believe that this word deserves a vowel-final short rafsi.)","g":"counterclockwise","r":["zucna","zucn"]},
